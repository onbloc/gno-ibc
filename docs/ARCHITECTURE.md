# Project Architecture

This document is a map of the first-party Gno packages and realms in this repository.\
It explains how the pure packages (`p/`) and stateful realms (`r/`) under the `onbloc` namespace fit together,\
what each one is responsible for, and how an IBC packet flows through them.

For per-module detail, follow the linked `README.md` of each component.\
For spec-level comparisons against the upstream references, see the [Spec Comparisons](README.md#spec-comparisons) section.

## Layer Model

The system is split into stateless **pure packages** (reusable libraries, no on-chain state) \
and stateful **realms** (persistent contracts). \
Realms further use an **upgradeable proxy / implementation** split: \
a stable proxy realm owns identity, storage, and access gates, \
while a swappable `v1` implementation realm holds the protocol logic behind an interface.

Each box is one runtime layer. \
A public-facing realm (proxy) keeps the stable identity and forwards to its swappable `v1` implementation; \
arrows show the call direction. \
Everything ultimately depends on the pure packages at the bottom.

## Realms (`r/onbloc`)

Stateful contracts. Each public-facing realm is an upgradeable proxy that delegates protocol logic to a versioned implementation realm.

| Realm                          | Role                                                                                                                                                                                  | README                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ibc/union/core`               | Proxy realm for the IBC Union core host. Owns stable identity, access-managed entrypoints, app registry, persistent store, events, and the upgrade point for the core implementation. | [README](../gno.land/r/onbloc/ibc/union/core/README.md)            |
| `ibc/union/core/v1`            | Installed core implementation behind `ICore`. Supplies client, connection, channel, packet, proof, batch, and app-registry logic.                                                     | —                                                                  |

| `ibc/union/apps/ucs03_zkgm/v1` | Installed ZKGM implementation behind `IApp`. Holds opcode dispatch (Call, TokenOrder, Batch, Forward), escrow/voucher accounting, and rate limiting.                                  | —                                                                  |
| `ibc/union/apps/transfer`      | Reference fungible-token transfer app (forked from gno-realms).                                                                                                                       | [README](../gno.land/r/onbloc/ibc/union/apps/transfer/README.md)   |
| `ibc/union/access`             | Shared access authority. Owns the `manager.State` from `p/onbloc/access/manager`; core and app realms share it as a single authority, keyed per target by package path.               | [README](../gno.land/r/onbloc/ibc/union/access/README.md)          |

### Why the proxy / implementation split

The proxy realm keeps a **stable package path** (so other realms can import it once and never re-wire) and holds all persistent state, \
while protocol logic lives in a replaceable `v1` realm. \
Upgrading swaps the installed implementation through the proxy's `upgrade.gno` registration point, \
without moving state or changing the import path callers depend on. \
See the [core](../gno.land/r/onbloc/ibc/union/core/README.md) and [ZKGM proxy](../gno.land/r/onbloc/ibc/union/apps/ucs03_zkgm/README.md) READMEs for the file-by-file breakdown.

## Pure Packages (`p/onbloc`)

Stateless libraries. They define shared types and interfaces, and provide codecs and verification primitives. Realms import these; the packages never touch on-chain state.

## Process Flows

Every public action follows the same proxy → implementation → pure-package layering.\
The four flows below — registering a light client, registering an app, sending coin out, and receiving it — cover the common lifecycle, including where the relayer and the counterparty Union chain come in.

> Throughout, a **relayer** is an off-chain process that watches both chains.\
> It carries packets and proofs between them: it reads a committed packet on the source chain, proves it to the destination chain, then reads the resulting acknowledgement and proves it back.\
> Nothing moves between chains without a relayer; the chains never talk directly.

### 1. Register a Light Client

A light client lets this chain verify the counterparty Union chain's state. Registration is two distinct steps:

1. **Register the client _type_.** `core.RegisterClient` ([core/client.gno](../gno.land/r/onbloc/ibc/union/core/client.gno)) installs a light-client implementation under a type name — `cometbls` or `state-lens/ics23/mpt`.\
   This is relayer/admin-gated through the access realm and only registers the _code_ that knows how to verify that client kind.
2. **Create a client _instance_.** `core.CreateClient` takes the counterparty's initial client and consensus state and asks the registered implementation to instantiate a concrete client, assigning it a client id.\
   That state is a snapshot of the counterparty Union chain (its chain id, latest height, and a trusted consensus root), supplied by the relayer that bootstraps the connection.

From here the relayer keeps the client fresh with `core.UpdateClient`, feeding new counterparty headers so the client can verify proofs at later heights.\
All later proof verification (steps 3–4 below) runs against the consensus state held by this client.

### 2. Register an App

An app realm (here, ZKGM) must register with core before it can send or receive packets, so core can route packet callbacks to it.

1. **App self-registers.** `ucs03_zkgm` calls `RegisterCoreApp` ([apps/ucs03_zkgm/register.gno](../gno.land/r/onbloc/ibc/union/apps/ucs03_zkgm/register.gno)), which crosses into `core.RegisterApp`.\
   Core derives the **port id from the caller's package path**, so the app's identity is its realm path and no separate id needs minting. (`core.RegisterAppForPort` is the admin-only override for binding a port explicitly.)
2. **App registers its receivers.** For ZKGM's `OP_CALL` opcode, a downstream contract registers itself with `zkgm.RegisterReceiver` from its own realm.\
   Core has no part in this; it is internal ZKGM routing for who handles an inbound call.

No relayer or counterparty is involved in registration — it is purely local wiring.\
It only matters once a channel is opened over the registered client and packets start flowing through the registered port.

### 3. Packet Send

A user sends coin out to the counterparty chain.

1. **User → ZKGM proxy.** The user calls `zkgm.Send` / `zkgm.SendRaw` ([apps/ucs03_zkgm/transfer.gno](../gno.land/r/onbloc/ibc/union/apps/ucs03_zkgm/transfer.gno)) **as an EOA**, attaching the coin to move.\
   The proxy forwards to `ucs03_zkgm/v1`.
2. **Escrow.** v1 checks that the attached coin matches the order, **escrows it in the proxy realm's account**, and increases the per-channel escrow balance.
3. **Commit + emit.** v1 encodes the ZKGM packet and calls `core.SendPacket` ([core/v1/packet.gno](../gno.land/r/onbloc/ibc/union/core/v1/packet.gno)).\
   Core checks the channel is open, writes a **packet commitment**, and emits a `PacketSend` event.

The commitment and event are the hand-off point: the **relayer** sees `PacketSend`, reads the commitment, and submits it with a membership proof to the counterparty Union chain, which runs its own verification and credits the recipient.\
The escrowed coin stays locked in the proxy account until a matching acknowledgement or timeout comes back.

### 4. Packet Receive

The inverse: a packet arrives from the counterparty and releases coin here. This path exercises every layer.

1. **Relayer → core proxy.** The relayer calls `core.PacketRecv` ([core/core.gno](../gno.land/r/onbloc/ibc/union/core/core.gno)) with the packets and a proof that the counterparty committed them.\
   This entrypoint is relayer-gated through the access realm.
2. **Proof verification.** Core resolves the channel's light client and calls `VerifyMembership`, proving the counterparty really committed this packet.\
   Inactive clients are rejected before any proof is verified; the CometBLS or state-lens client does the actual cryptographic verification.
3. **Core → app.** Core records the packet receipt, looks up the destination app by port, and dispatches `IApp.OnRecvPacket` into the ZKGM proxy.
4. **ZKGM v1 dispatch.** The proxy forwards to `ucs03_zkgm/v1`, which decodes the packet and routes each instruction by opcode: Call, TokenOrder, Batch, or Forward.
5. **TokenOrder effects.** The TokenOrder releases coin from the proxy escrow account to the receiver, charges the per-channel rate limit, and pays the relayer its fee.
6. **Acknowledgement.** Core writes the acknowledgement and emits `WriteAck`.\
   The relayer reads this ack and proves it back to the counterparty so the original send can settle (or refund on failure). Forward packets defer this step via the async-ack path.

Acknowledgement and timeout on the sending side follow the same proxy → implementation → pure-package layering in reverse, consuming the ack/timeout proof the relayer brings back.
